# Emotion-Recognition-Deep-Learning
This project implements a Mood Classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It includes a Jupyter Notebook for model training and a Flask web application that allows users to upload images and predict the mood displayed, demonstrating an end-to-end deep learning deployment for emotion recognition.
